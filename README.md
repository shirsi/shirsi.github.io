# shirsi.github.io
For this project, I created a fanpage of some of my favorite characters using https://superheroapi.com/ api.


I create third different functions for this application. First, carousel for images on the bottom of the page. Then the search and favorite function. Here is a link to my site: https://shirsi.github.io/index.html

I was unable to filter out broken images from the carousel. I did attempt to add a modal on the carousel but I didn't have enough time to resolve it.
